| ---------------| --------------------------- |
| Problem | Paraphrase generation is important for many downstream tasks, but generating high-quality paraphrases is challenging due to the need to balance semantic similarity and linguistic diversity. Previous methods have focused on controlling specific aspects of the paraphrase, such as its syntactic tree, but have not allowed for direct control of the overall quality of the generated paraphrase. |
| Solution | The authors propose a new model, called QCPG, which allows for direct control of the quality dimensions of the generated paraphrase. They also develop a method for identifying points in the quality control space that are expected to yield optimal generated paraphrases. The authors demonstrate that their approach is able to generate high-quality paraphrases that maintain the original meaning while achieving higher linguistic diversity than uncontrolled baselines.|
| Introduction | 1. QCPG is a Quality Controlled Paraphrase Generation model that takes an input sentence and three quality constraints, represented by a three-dimensional vector of semantic similarity, syntactic and lexical distances, and produces a target sentence that conforms to the specified quality constraints.<br />2. The proposed constraints are simpler than previously suggested ones, such as parse trees or keyword lists, allowing the model the freedom to choose how to attain the desired quality levels. This enables flexibility in generating paraphrases of various flavors and even non-paraphrases that may be useful for downstream tasks. <br />3. Despite the mixed quality of the training data and the scarcity of high-quality data, the QCPG model is able to learn high-quality paraphrasing behavior, increasing the linguistic diversity of the generated paraphrases without decreasing the semantic similarity compared to the uncontrolled baseline. Overall, the QCPG model enables direct control of the three quality dimensions, providing flexibility with respect to the specific requirements of the task at hand and opening a range of generation possibilities. |
| Method | 1. Quantifying Paraphrase Quality : <br/>
* The paper proposes a three-dimensional vector to represent the quality of paraphrases, with the dimensions being semantic similarity, syntactic variation, and lexical variation. i.e. paraphrase quality as a three dimensional vector q(s, s′) =(qsem(s, s′), qsyn(s, s′), qlex(s, s′)), where q~sem is a measure of semantic similarity, and qsyn and qlex are measures of syntactic and lexical variation, respectively.
