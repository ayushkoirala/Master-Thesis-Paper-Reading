| Topic | Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction as Paraphrase Generation |
| ---------------| --------------------------- |
| Problem | The problem addressed in the paper is that existing approaches for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) only consider the detection of partial sentiment elements (e.g. aspect category or sentiment polarity)  instead of predicting all four elements (aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, and sentiment polarity) in a comprehensive and complete manner. The authors introduce a new task called Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) which aims to jointly detect all four sentiment elements in a given opinionated sentence. |
| SOlution | The solution proposed in the paper is a novel PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm to cast the aspect-sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) task as a paraphrase generation process. This approach solves the ASQP task in an end-to-end manner, eliminating potential error propagation in a pipeline solution. The PARAPHRASE modeling framework also allows for the full exploitation of the semantics of the sentiment elements by learning to generate them in natural language form. The authors conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and show that their proposed method outperforms existing methods and has the capacity for cross-task transfer. |
| Introduction | 1. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining problem that aims to analyze sentiment information at the aspect level. <br /> 2. Four fundamental sentiment elements are involved in ABSA: aspect category (the type of the concerned aspect), aspect term (can be explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the text), opinion term (describes the opinion towards the aspect), and sentiment polarity (sentiment class). Given an example sentence “The pasta is over-cooked!”, the sentiment elements are “food quality”, “pasta”, “overcooked”, and “negative”, respectively. <br /> 3. Many research efforts have been made on ABSA to predict or extract the sentiment elements, with early studies focusing on the prediction of a single element and more recent works proposing to extract multiple associated sentiment elements at the same time. <br /> 4. Despite their popularity, these ABSA tasks only attempt to perform partial prediction instead of providing a complete aspect-level sentiment picture, i.e., identifying the four sentiment elements in one shot. <br /> 5. The paper introduces the aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) task, which aims to predict all four components (aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, sentiment polarity) for a given opinionated sentence. It proposes to tackle the ASQP task using a sequence-to-sequence (S2S) approach instead of the traditional pipeline approach. This approach eliminates potential error propagation and fully exploits the rich label semantic information by learning to generate the sentiment elements in natural language form. <br /> 6. The authors propose a novel PARAPHRASE modeling paradigm to tackle two challenges in ASQP task: linearizing the sentiment information for S2S learning and utilizing pretrained models. The paradigm transforms the ASQP task into a paraphrase generation problem where the sentiment quad is linearized into a natural language sentence. This allows the use of large pretrained generative models such as T5 by fine-tuning with the input-target pairs. The rich label semantics and pretrained knowledge are combined in the form of natural sentences. |
