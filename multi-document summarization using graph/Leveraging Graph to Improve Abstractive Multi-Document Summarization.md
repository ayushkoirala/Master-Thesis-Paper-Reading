| Topic | Leveraging Graph to Improve Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization |
| ---------------| --------------------------- |
| Problem | The paper addresses the challenges of Multi-document Summarization (MDS), which is a complex process due to the need to effectively represent multiple documents and manage long summaries. MDS involves summarizing information from multiple documents that may have overlapping, complementary, or contradictory content, making it difficult to extract salient information, detect redundancy, and generate coherent summaries. |
|Solution Approach |  <strong>1. Graph Representation:</strong> </br> The proposed model leverages explicit graph representations of documents, such as similarity graphs and discourse graphs, to better encode cross-document relations and guide the summary generation process.</br> <strong>Graph-Informed Attention Mechanisms:</strong> These mechanisms help integrate the graph structures into both document encoding and summary generation, enhancing the model's ability to process and summarize complex document sets.</br>
