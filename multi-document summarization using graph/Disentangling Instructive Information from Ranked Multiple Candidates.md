|Topic|  Disentangling Instructive Information from Ranked Multiple Candidates for Multi-Document Scientific Summarization |
|----------------|------------------|
|Problem | <strong>1. Global Information Management:</strong> Current methods struggle to effectively integrate and utilize the vast and diverse information spread across multiple documents, which is crucial for generating comprehensive summaries.<br /> <strong>2.Decoding Guidance: </strong> There is a lack of sufficient guidance during the decoding phase of summarization, making it difficult to produce coherent and contextually accurate summaries that align with the global content of multiple documents.|
|Solution| <strong> Summary Candidates Introduction: </strong>The approach introduces the concept of summary candidates, which are potential summaries generated by existing methods. These candidates serve as additional data points to guide the summarization process. <br /> <strong> 2. Candidates Ranking Module:</strong> This module assesses the quality of summary candidates using a specialized pairwise comparison method. It selects higher-quality candidates, providing a richer set of data for guiding the summarization.<br /> <strong>3.Instructive Information Disentangling:</strong> Using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), the framework disentangles the instructive information contained in the summary candidates into positive and negative latent variables. This disentanglement allows for more nuanced control over the information that influences the summary generation. <br /> <strong>4. Information Augmented Decoding:</strong> In the decoding phase, the disentangled positive and negative information is incorporated into the summary generation process. This method enhances the decoder's ability to focus on relevant content while avoiding less useful information, thereby improving the quality and relevance of the generated summaries. |

|Motivation | 1.  Positive vs Negative Information from Summary Candidates : <br /> Multi-Document Scientific Summarization (MDSS), the positive and negative information derived from summary candidates are compared against the "gold summary" or "ground truth summary." here, "summary candidates" refer to potential summaries generated during the first stage of the summarization process. Positive information (Ip) is defined as the overlap between the content of summary candidates and the gold summary. It represents the unigrams (single words). Negative information is the difference in unigrams between the summary candidates and the gold summary. Specifically, it includes unigrams that are present in the summary candidates but not in the gold summary. <br />  Effectiveness of Selecting High-Quality Candidates: <br /> The approach hypothesizes that higher-quality summary candidates, which are closer to the gold standard, are more beneficial for generating accurate and comprehensive final summaries. : By re-ranking candidates based on quality metrics like ROUGE-1, which measures the overlap of unigrams with the gold summary, the model can selectively focus on the more informative candidates.  The strategy emphasizes maximizing the use of positive information from the top-ranked candidates. The hypothesis is that a greater amount of positive information will lead to more informative and accurate summaries. |

|Method| 1. Candidates Ranking Module :<br /> 1. Ranking Criteria: The candidates are ranked according to the ROUGE-1 metric, which assesses the overlap of unigrams between the candidate summary and a reference summary. <br /> Binary Classification Approach: The module uses a binary classification system to determine whether a candidate should be ranked higher. This involves a detailed comparison and re-ranking based on learned features. <br /> Encoding with Longformer: Due to the typically large size of source documents, the Longformer encoder is used to handle extensive text inputs efficiently. It processes the text of source papers and candidates, generating embeddings that capture contextual nuances.<br /> Representation and Prediction: The embeddings from the Longformer are concatenated and fed into a feed-forward network to compute the likelihood of each candidate being a high-quality summary. The final output is a probability score for each candidate. |

|Method| Instructive Information Modeling and Disentangling :<br /> Text Encoding: The encoder (part of the Transformer architecture) processes text from source documents, candidates, and the gold summary to create comprehensive embeddings that capture the essence of each input type. <br /> Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE): This component uses CVAE to create latent variables representing positive and negative aspects of the information in summary candidates. These variables help in capturing the nuanced differences between useful and less relevant content. <br /> Modeling of Latent Variables: For each candidate, two sets of latent variables (positive and negative) are defined and optimized during training to effectively represent the instructive qualities of the candidate summaries. <br /> Disentangling Process: The framework uses specific training objectives to ensure that the positive and negative information is clearly separated and identifiable, enhancing the system's ability to focus on relevant content while disregarding irrelevant details.|
