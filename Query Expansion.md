|Problems | The problem addressed in the paper is query-focused multi-document summarization, where the goal is to generate a summary that specifically addresses the information needs expressed in a given query. Unlike generic summarization, query-focused summarization requires the summary to be biased towards the query, in addition to fulfilling the general requirements of a summary. The challenge lies in understanding and expanding the query effectively, as the queries are often complex real-world questions and the information provided may be insufficient. |
|Solution|The paper proposes an improved query expansion method for query-oriented multi-document summarization. The authors employ multiple query expansion techniques, including using WordNet synonyms for the query itself and expanding the query based on the document set using mean expansion, variance expansion, and TextRank expansion.<br />To enhance the calculation of the sentence similarity matrix in the manifold ranking process, the authors introduce three measures: sentence TF-ISF similarity, word overlap similarity, and sentence proximity information. These measures aim to capture the contextual relevance and relationships among sentences, improving the effectiveness of the graph ranking algorithm.|
