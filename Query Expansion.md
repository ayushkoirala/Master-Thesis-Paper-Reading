|Topic |Using Query Expansion in Manifold Ranking for Query-Oriented Multi-Document Summarization|
|-----|----|
|Problems | The problem addressed in the paper is query-focused multi-document summarization, where the goal is to generate a summary that specifically addresses the information needs expressed in a given query. Unlike generic summarization, query-focused summarization requires the summary to be biased towards the query, in addition to fulfilling the general requirements of a summary. The challenge lies in understanding and expanding the query effectively, as the queries are often complex real-world questions and the information provided may be insufficient. |
|Solution|The paper proposes an improved query expansion method for query-oriented multi-document summarization. The authors employ multiple query expansion techniques, including using WordNet synonyms for the query itself and expanding the query based on the document set using mean expansion, variance expansion, and TextRank expansion.<br />To enhance the calculation of the sentence similarity matrix in the manifold ranking process, the authors introduce three measures: sentence TF-ISF similarity, word overlap similarity, and sentence proximity information. These measures aim to capture the contextual relevance and relationships among sentences, improving the effectiveness of the graph ranking algorithm.|
|Method| 1.Preprocessing:<br />Perform sentence segmentation, word segmentation, word stemming, and TF-ISF (Term Frequency-Inverse Sentence Frequency)Calculation for each sentence in the documents and the query.Remove stop words, emails, digital characters, punctuation marks, and single characters.Use only content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) after morphological analysis.<br />2.Automatic Text Summarization:<br />Utilize the method used by Wan et al. (2007) for the extraction process of automatic text summarization.<br />Manifold Ranking (MR):<br />Manifold Ranking is a universal graph ranking algorithm used to rank data points along their underlying manifold structure.Construct a similarity matrix (W) between all sentences.Initialize a vector (y) representing sentence scores, with y0 = 1 for the query sentence and yi = 0 for other sentences.Propagate the scores of query sentences to sentences similar to query points through similarity.Iterate until the scores of each sentence remain unchanged.The ranking algorithm is defined by the formula L(f) in the provided text.<br />Query Expansion:<br />Expand the query sentence to improve the information coverage.Two methods of query expansion are used: WordNet-based expansion and expansion based on mean and variance.WordNet is a word sense database used to calculate semantic similarity between words.Calculate word similarity using the maximum similarity between two word semantic items.Expand the query sentence using word meaning expansion, average TF-ISF, and variance TF-ISF.<br />Word Similarity Filtering:<br />Filter the word similarities to remove those with little practical significance.Apply vertical filtering based on the path length between words.Apply horizontal filtering based on the number of similarities between a word and other words.<br />Query Expansion by TextRank:<br />Select informative and query-relevant words based on the TextRank algorithm.Add the selected words to the original query sentence.<br />Sentence Similarity Calculation:<br />Calculate the similarity between two sentences using TF-ISF cosine similarity, word overlap, and adjacency similarity.Combine the three measures using weighting factors (αA, αoverlap, αpeer) to obtain the similarity matrix (W).|
