#`WSL-DS: Weakly Supervised Learning with Distant Supervision for Query Focused Multi-Document Abstractive Summarization`

|Problem|The authors address the problem of query-focused multi-document summarization (QF-MDS), where the objective is to generate a summary of a set of documents that answers a given query. This task is important as users often require concise summaries from various sources to fulfill their information needs. The challenge is that the datasets available for QF-MDS do not have labeled training data, making it difficult to apply supervised training approaches commonly used in neural summarization models. Additionally, existing transformer-based summarization models struggle with computational complexities when dealing with long documents.|
|Solution|To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a novel weakly supervised approach that leverages distant supervision to generate weak reference summaries for each individual document from multi-document gold reference summaries. They utilize pre-trained sentence similarity models to generate these weak reference summaries. Furthermore, they introduce an iterative approach that employs a pre-trained single-document generic summarization model, fine-tuned for query-focused abstractive summarization, and extend it for the QF-MDS task.|
