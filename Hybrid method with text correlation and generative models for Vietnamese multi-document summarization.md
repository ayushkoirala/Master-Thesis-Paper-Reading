| Problem Statement | Multi-document summarization is a challenging task, especially when dealing with the Vietnamese language, that requires the selection of the most important information from multiple documents to create a coherent summary. Extractive and abstractive models have been proposed for this task, but abstractive models are more difficult to train as they require a deep understanding of the input documents. Furthermore, the development of pretrained language models for Vietnamese presents new opportunities for improving multi-document summarization performance. |
| Solution Apprach | In this paper, the authors propose a pipeline abstractive method for multi-document summarization in Vietnamese. The method consists of three main phases. In the first phase, single document extraction is performed to extract the most important sentences from each document. In the second phase, the candidate sentences from the single documents are concatenated, and a multi-document extraction is performed to produce quickview summaries. Finally, in the third phase, multi-document abstractive models are built from the quickview results to generate more coherent and natural-sounding summaries. In this paper, the authors propose a method for multi-document summarization based on cluster similarity. The proposed method is based on a hybrid model that combines a modified version of the PageRank algorithm and a text correlation considerations mechanism. The method first clusters the documents based on their similarity and then generates summaries by selecting the most important sentences from each cluster. |
